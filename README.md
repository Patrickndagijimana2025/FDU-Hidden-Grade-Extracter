## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

   ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure your user information. Open `main.py` and locate the section where you need to input your UIS and password.

password = "your_password"
```

Replace `"your_uis"` and `"your_password"` with your actual FDU UIS and password.
